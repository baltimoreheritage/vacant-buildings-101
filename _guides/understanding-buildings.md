Understanding vacant buildings begins by asking a few simple questions:

- Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings?
- Why is it hard to fix up and reuse vacant buildings?
- What does Baltimore do about vacant buildings?

These might sound like simple questions but they are difficult to answer.

Counting vacant buildings depends on how you define a “vacant building.” All unoccupied buildings are not “vacant” by any definition. However, many local housing advocates are concerned that city’s list of “vacant building notices” is significantly less than the true total of abandoned buildings.

Identifying barriers to building reuse depends on who you ask. If you are a developer, you may focus on the difficulty of acquiring vacant buildings. If you are an urban planner, you may talk about the lack of market demand.

Describing the city’s policy and approach to vacant buildings depends on if you look at individual buildings, whole neighborhoods, or city-wide policies. In all cases, the city’s approach to vacant buildings has developed over decades and continues to change based on direction set by elected officials and city staff along with the demands of Baltimore residents.

## Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings?

Baltimore has a lot of vacant buildings. Depending on how you count, the total ranges between sixteen thousand and thirty-two thousand vacant buildings—mostly brick rowhouses built before World War II.

You won’t find vacant houses in every neighborhood. In the neighborhoods like Hampden, Remington and Medfield, where most residents are white, less than 1% of homes are vacant—around sixty buildings in 2014. In the neighborhoods of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park, where most residents are black, over one-third of residential properties are vacant—more than two thousand buildings in 2014.

Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings? Why do some neighborhoods have a large number of vacant buildings and other neighborhoods have only a few? To answer these questions, we need to ask a few more:

- How does Baltimore define a “vacant building”?
- How many vacant buildings does Baltimore have?
- Why did the number of vacant buildings increase over time?

### How does Baltimore define a “vacant building”?

Different cities use different definitions of what qualifies as a “vacant building”. Having a clear definition is important for anyone who wants to count the number of vacant buildings in Baltimore.

Is every unoccupied home a vacant building? No. For example, a home might be unoccupied during a major renovation. If a property owner dies without a will, a building may sit empty while a court decides who it belongs to.

Is every home that causes problems a vacant building? Not really. An overgrown lawn or trash-littered property might be a bother or a hazard even if the house is occupied by an owner or tenant.

If a building is unoccupied and…

- Unsafe or unfit for people to live or work inside the building, or
- Has two code violations that have not been fixed, or
- Has six code violations in the past year


...then the building meets the definition of a vacant building in Baltimore City.

Even if a building is unoccupied for an extended period of time, Baltimore Housing does not consider the building “vacant” until it meets these criteria and the city issues a vacant building notice (known as “VBN”). This official definition appears in Section 116.4 of the [Building, Fire and Related Codes of Baltimore City](http://ca.baltimorecity.gov/codes/Art%2000%20-%20Bldg,%20Fire.pdf). The definition of a vacant lot is found in [Article 13, Subtitle 11](http://ca.baltimorecity.gov/codes/Art%2013%20-%20Housing.pdf), of the Baltimore City Code. Vacant lots and vacant buildings are both considered vacant property.

Since the 1970s, Baltimore's Code Enforcement office has maintained a "Vacant House File" as a database on the city's computer system. Since the early 2000s, this data has been available in real-time to city staff and, more recently, to the public on the [Open Baltimore data portal](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Housing-Development/Vacant-Buildings/qqcv-ihn5).

Today, Baltimore Housing reports that the city has approximately 16,000 vacant buildings and 14,000 vacant lots for a total of around 30,000 vacant properties. More than 75% of all vacant property in Baltimore City is privately owned. But if you use a different definition of vacant buildings you might come up with a different number. The U.S. Census Bureau counts vacant dwelling units coming up with 46,782 (2010). Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance made an estimate in 2015 based on both city and Census Bureau criteria of 31,370.

A [2015 report on Vacants to Value](http://www.abell.org/publications/vacants-value) from the Abell Foundation, notes that some advocates are "concerned that Baltimore Housing's metric undercounts the number of vacant properties and thus understates the city's vacancy problem." In 2014, volunteers with [Housing Our Neighbors](http://www.honbaltimore.org/) (HON), surveyed unoccupied houses in McElderry Park and Middle East by walking each block in these neighborhoods, talking to residents, and using a checklist to decide what houses were vacant. HON counted 381 vacant buildings including 159 (41.7%) buildings where Baltimore Housing had not assigned a vacant building notice (VBN).

### How many vacant buildings does Baltimore have?

Baltimore Housing reports that the city has about 16,000 vacant buildings and 14,000 vacant lots. These add up to about 30,000 vacant properties. More than 75% of all vacant property in Baltimore City is privately owned. But if you use a different definition of vacant buildings you might come up with a different number.

### Why did the number of vacant buildings increase over time?

Scholars and researchers who study urban history, housing, and public policy have studied the history of vacancy and population loss in Baltimore and similar legacy cities. Their research and writing points to three big reasons for the city’s large number of vacant buildings:

- Job and population loss
- Suburban growth
- Racial segregation and discrimination

#### Job and population loss

Over the past six decades, Baltimore City has lost population. In 1950, 950,000 people lived in the city. Sixty years later, the population had dropped by 325,000 people. In the decades after World War II, the city lost thousands of factory jobs to suburban industrial parks, to increased automation, and to Southern states with anti-union policies. This pattern of declining investment in downtown Baltimore, a shrinking number of well-paying industrial jobs, and growing financial insecurity for Baltimore residents forced thousands of Baltimore residents to move away and, in some cases, leave abandoned homes behind.

#### Suburban growth

As Baltimore City lost residents, the surrounding counties gained both population and jobs. New homes in the suburbs attracted residents who might otherwise live in existing homes in Baltimore City. The movement of new factories and shopping malls brought employment opportunities to the suburbs but limited access to employment for city residents. The state and federal government subsidized suburban growth in Baltimore with funding for new highways like Interstate 695 and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) mortgage aid. Racist policies in the planning and administration of these programs, however, limited the benefits to white residents. As the suburbs grew, existing patterns of segregation and inequality became even more deeply entrenched.

#### Racial segregation and discrimination

Vacant buildings today are the legacy of segregated housing and racial discrimination in the past. Notorious practices like "redlining" in the 1930s and "block-busting" in the 1950s and 1960s are not relics of the past. Even in the present, African American residents in the Baltimore region are unable to access home loans, employment opportunities, and transportation to the same extent as white residents.

As a result of these policies, many vacant buildings are located in historically segregated African American neighborhoods in east and west Baltimore. This is illustrated by looking beyond Baltimore’s average vacancy rate of 7.67% (2013) to consider the disparate impact of vacant buildings on black and white residents. An analysis is based on data from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance [Vital Signs 2014](http://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/) report finds that in neighborhoods where less than 50% of residents are black, the vacancy rate is 2.54%. In neighborhoods where more than 80% of residents are black, the vacancy rate is 13.54%.

| Community Statistical Areas (2010) | Average vacancy rate (2013) | Percent of total vacant properties (2013) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| All areas                          | 7.67%                       | 100%                                     |
| Areas with <50% black residents    | 2.54%                       | 34.60%                                   |
| Areas with >50% black residents    | 10.37%                      | 65.46%                                   |
| Areas with >80% black residents    | 13.54%                      | 42.90%                                   |

## Why is it hard to fix up and reuse vacant buildings?

It can be difficult for any individual, whether they are a small developer or a handy homeowner, to fix up and reuse vacant buildings. If a building is left vacant for too long, wiring and plumbing might be stripped out and sold for scrap metal. If the roof of a vacant building begins to leak, the structure of the interior suffer from rot and decay. Issues such as these increase the cost and challenges associated with fixing up vacant buildings.

It can be confusing, however, when you see how these barriers are easily overcome in one neighborhood but seem insurmountable in another. In one neighborhood, vacant buildings are quickly purchased by small developers, rehabilitated, and sold at the asking price. In another neighborhood, a near-identical house is left to fall apart. What is the difference? Different neighborhoods have different housing markets.

The housing market is the result of decisions by property owners, homeowners, developers, and tenants; along with the actions and policies of real estate agents, banks and insurance companies, local, state, and federal government, and more. All of these decisions and actions help determine how much it costs to buy a home or rent an apartment and how quickly tenants fill apartments or residents buy houses.

These three questions are key to understanding how difficult it may be to fix up a vacant building (and even whether a building is abandoned in the first place):

1. Where is the building located?
2. What is the physical condition and characteristics of the building?
3. What is the condition of the housing market in the area?

Three areas where we see these questions at work include:

- housing market typologies
- the market gap
- costs for rehabilitation or demolition

### What is the housing market typology?

Baltimore City uses a housing market typology to help understand the condition of the local housing market at a block by block scale. The city's goal is to match public investments to neighborhood housing market conditions. For example, city officials want to avoid spending public money on demolition in neighborhoods where there is potential for a small developer to reuse and rehabilitate vacant buildings. Baltimore created the city's first map of housing market typologies in 2005 but has updated the analysis in 2008, 2011, and 2014 to keep up with changing market conditions.

The housing typology is created using a type of statistical analysis known as [clustering or cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis). The typology is based on several different market charateristics including:

- Vacant building notices
- Residential building permits (less than $10,000)
- Housing units per square mile (a measure of density)
- Sales price variation
- Foreclosure filings
- Commercial and industrial land use
- Vacant lots
- Owner occupancy
- Median sales price

This analysis is used to map areas into categories ranging from the strongest to weakest housing markets:

- Regional Choice
- Middle Market
- Stressed

Both "Middle Market" and "Stressed" areas are divided up into subcategories such as Middle Market Choice or Middle Market Stressed.

You can learn more about the housing market typologies from the [Baltimore Department of Planning](http://planning.baltimorecity.gov/planning-plans/typology) or learn more about housing conditions in your neighborhood with the [BNIA-JFI Community Profiles](http://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/cprofiles/). You can also find the housing market typology for any block or property using [codeMap](http://cels.baltimorehousing.org/codemap/codeMap.html).

### What is the market gap?

In neighborhoods with distressed housing markets, where there are few people with the interest and money to buy homes and the market values of buildings are low, developers (both private and nonprofit) face a big problem: **the market gap**.

The market gap is the difference between what a building costs to purchase and rehabilitate and and the rents (or purchase price) that most people can pay. The market gap is a barrier to the reuse of vacant buildings. The market gap is also a barrier to the construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing. Take a look at the Urban Institute's interactive feature for a closer look at this topic: [The cost of affordable housing: Does it pencil out?](http://apps.urban.org/features/cost-of-affordable-housing/)

Sometimes changing market conditions can surprise a developer with an unexpected gap. For example, in 2008, local nonprofit developer [Jubilee Baltimore](http://www.jubileebaltimore.org/) redeveloped three vacant buildings at 1125, 1127, and 1129 Hollins Street for a total of $858,000. Jubilee Baltimore hoped to sell the buildings into owner-occupied homes but the arrival of the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis) made it difficult to find interested buyers. Adding to the problems was a 2009 assessment that put the total value of the three properties at just $330,000. In December 2014, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development forgave loans to Jubilee Baltimore and provided additional grant support to cover the gap on this project along with projects in the Penn North and Eutaw Place/Madison Avenue historic districts where the developer encountered similar challenges.

| Project                                  | Development Cost | Assessed Value | Subsidy required | % Market Gap |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1125, 1127, and 1129 Hollins Street (CL52501) | $858,000         | $330,000       | $528,000         | 62%          |

Source: [Maryland Board of Public Works, December 17, 2014, Agenda](http://bpw.maryland.gov/MeetingDocs/2014-Dec-17-Agenda.pdf)

In Hollins Market, public funding from the state filled the market gap and Jubilee Baltimore continues to maintain the properties as affordable rental housing. If funding is not available to fill the gap, a project may not happen at all.

### What does it cost to tear down or fix up a vacant building?

While private developers focus on the market gap for a rehabilitation project, residents or city officials may have other concerns: the public safety risks of a building near collapse or the importance of preserving homeownership in a changing neighborhood. This table, based on estimates by Peter Duvall, Neighborhood Revitalization Program Manager for Strong City Baltimore, provides another way of looking at the costs associated with these different activities.

| **Activity**                             | **Approximate Cost** |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Demolishing a single rowhouse            | $15-20,000           |
| Building a cinder block wall to support an adjoining rowhouse | $10,000              |
| Relocating a tenant before demolition    | $25,000              |
| Acquiring a non-owner occupied rowhouse  | $10,000              |
| Relocating a homeowner before demolition | $175,000             |
| Installing a new roof on a vacant rowhouse | $35,000 or more      |
| Rehabilitating a distressed rowhouse     | $100,000 or more     |
| Subsidizing rehabilitation with a grant to a developer | $20-30,000           |

To see how these activities work together, consider a hypothetical example of a block with eight rowhouses including:

- four city-owned vacant properties
- three privately-owned houses occupied by tenants
- one house occupied by a homeowner

Here are the options you could consider:

| Option                          | Description of costs                     | Total cost           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Demolish the vacant buildings   | Demolition could cost from $60,000 to $80,000 plus an additional $10,000 to $20,000 to rebuild party walls for the attached occupied buildings. | $70,000 to $100,000  |
| Demolish the entire block       | Demolition could cost $120,000 to $160,000 plus an additional $105,000 for acquiring houses and relocating tenants and another $175,000 to relocate the homeowner. | $400,000 to $440,000 |
| Stabilize the vacant buildings  | Installing new roofs on the four vacant buildings could cost $140,000 or more. | $140,000 or more     |
| Redevelop the vacant  buildings | Rehabilitating the four vacant buildings could cost $400,000 or more. | $400,000 or more     |

## What does Baltimore do about vacant buildings?
