There are several different sources you can use to research the ownership, history, and current status of a vacant building. As you learn more about a building, keep track of each piece of information and all of the documents you collect. If you are researching multiple properties, consider keeping your information in a spreadsheet so you can easily compare one property to another.

A community member can identify the owner of any property in the state of Maryland by using the [State Department of Assessments and Taxation](http://www.dat.state.md.us/) (SDAT) website. SDAT's website will have the name and address of the person or corporate entity that last purchased the property and recorded the deed.

SDAT is also the agency that keeps information on business entities operating within Maryland, so community members can also look up more information about a business entity that owns a particular property; neighbors may want to know, for example, where the business entity is headquartered, whether it is in good standing, and who is the resident agent for the business.

### Maryland Land Records Online

Residents who want to use this service will have to register for an account. The Land Records system will allow neighbors to see the recorded deeds of any properties.

The [Baltimore City Department of Finance](http://cityservices.baltimorecity.gov/realproperty) provides real property tax account information online. This is another tool for locating the current owner of a property when you only know the street address. This tool will also allow citizens to find all of the properties in Baltimore City owned by a specific person or entity.

### Maryland Judiciary Case Search

On [Maryland Judiciary Case Search](http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/), a community member can find information on any lawsuits filed in the state of Maryland by or against a particular corporate entity or attached to a particular piece of property (e.g., foreclosure).

### Bid Baltimore

[Bid Baltimore](https://www.bidbaltimore.com/) is the website maintained by Baltimore City to run its annual tax sale of liens on properties. Liens are legal claims to property to secure the payment of debt. Liens can be attached to a property if its owner neglects to pay real estate taxes, water bills, or other debts. Bid Baltimore shows whether a property owner owes any debt to the City. If it does, and if the City sells that debt to an investor, the investor may become the owner of the property if the owner does not pay the debt.
