### Set up a housing or development committee

A community association or group of concerned neighbors can set up a housing committee or development committee. This group can identify nuisance properties, track issues at specific properties, and think strategically about redevelopment within a neighborhood. Some individuals and groups have even done house-by-house surveys of entire neighborhoods, prioritizing properties based on, for example, ownership or condition of the properties.

### Conduct a survey of residents

Do you know what the members of your community value about their neighborhood or what they would like to change? The results of a survey may surprise you. Ask questions about why neighbors chose to live in your neighborhood, what they want to protect, and what they would like to improve.

### Meet with your elected officials

If you do not know the name of your City Council representative, you can find their name and contact information [on the Baltimore City Council website](http://cityservices.baltimorecity.gov/citycouncil/). You should also familiarize yourselves with your state representatives: each state legislative district is represented by one state senator and three state delegates. You can find their names and contact information [on the state legislature’s website](http://www.mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmmain.aspx?pid=legisrpage&tab=subject6&poptype=find&popid=).

### Join local coalitions

Your neighborhood can work with other neighborhoods to address shared problems and concerns. One example of a coalition focused on vacant housing is [Baltimore RENEW](http://www.baltimorerenew.org/) (Residents Engaged in Neighborhood Empowerment and Well-being). RENEW is a membership organization made up of individual residents, community associations and business owners that are seeking to eliminate nuisance and vacant properties in Baltimore City neighborhoods.

### Create a neighborhood plan

Your neighborhood may already be included in a neighborhood or small area plan from the [Baltimore City Department of Planning](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/). Neighborhood organizations can also try to get help from local nonprofits, like the [Neighborhood Design Center](http://www.ndc-md.org/), in creating a plan to deal with housing and development issues.

### Take legal action using the Community Bill of Rights

The Community Bill of Rights ([Md. Code Ann., Real Prop. § 14-123](http://www.baltimorerenew.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Community-Bill-of-Rights-14-123-as-amended-effective-10-1-12.pdf)) authorizes Baltimore City community associations to seek the enforcement of many Baltimore City Code provisions. For example, the Community Bill of Rights permits a community association to file suit against the owner of a neglected property and ask the court to order the owner to clean up and maintain their property.
