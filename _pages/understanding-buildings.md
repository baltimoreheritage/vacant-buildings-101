Understanding vacant buildings begins by asking a few simple questions:

- Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings?
- Why is it hard to fix up and reuse vacant buildings?
- What does Baltimore do about vacant buildings?

These might sound like simple questions but they are difficult to answer.

Counting vacant buildings depends on how you define a “vacant building.” All unoccupied buildings are not “vacant” by any definition. However, many local housing advocates are concerned that city’s list of “vacant building notices” is significantly less than the true total of abandoned buildings. 

Identifying barriers to building reuse depends on who you ask. If you are a developer, you may focus on the difficulty of acquiring vacant buildings. If you are an urban planner, you may talk about the lack of market demand.

Describing the city’s policy and approach to vacant buildings depends on if you look at individual buildings, whole neighborhoods, or city-wide policies. In all cases, the city’s approach to vacant buildings has developed over decades and continues to change based on direction set by elected officials and city staff along with the demands of Baltimore residents.

## Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings?

Baltimore has a lot of vacant buildings. Depending on how you count, the total ranges between sixteen thousand and thirty-two thousand vacant buildings—mostly brick rowhouses built before World War II.

You won’t find vacant houses in every neighborhood. In the neighborhoods like Hampden, Remington and Medfield, where most residents are white, less than 1% of homes are vacant—around sixty buildings in 2014. In the neighborhoods of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park, where most residents are black, over one-third of residential properties are vacant—more than two thousand buildings in 2014.

Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings? Why do some neighborhoods have a large number of vacant buildings and other neighborhoods have only a few? To answer these questions, we need to ask a few more:

- How does Baltimore define a “vacant building”?
- How many vacant buildings does Baltimore have?
- Why did the number of vacant buildings increase over time?

### How does Baltimore define a “vacant building”?

Different cities use different definitions of what qualifies as a “vacant building”. Having a clear definition is important for anyone who wants to count the number of vacant buildings in Baltimore.

Is every unoccupied home a vacant building? No. For example, a home might be unoccupied during a major renovation. If a property owner dies without a will, a building may sit empty while a court decides who it belongs to.

Is every home that causes problems a vacant building? Not really. An overgrown lawn or trash-littered property might be a bother or a hazard even if the house is occupied by an owner or tenant.

If a building is unoccupied and…

- Unsafe or unfit for people to live or work inside the building, or
- Has two code violations that have not been fixed, or
- Has six code violations in the past year


...then the building meets the definition of a vacant building in Baltimore City.

Even if a building is unoccupied for an extended period of time, Baltimore Housing does not consider the building “vacant” until it meets these criteria and the city issues a vacant building notice (known as “VBN”). This official definition appears in Section 116.4 of the [Building, Fire and Related Codes of Baltimore City](http://ca.baltimorecity.gov/codes/Art%2000%20-%20Bldg,%20Fire.pdf). The definition of a vacant lot is found in [Article 13, Subtitle 11](http://ca.baltimorecity.gov/codes/Art%2013%20-%20Housing.pdf), of the Baltimore City Code. Vacant lots and vacant buildings are both considered vacant property.

Since the 1970s, Baltimore's Code Enforcement office has maintained a "Vacant House File" as a database on the city's computer system. Since the early 2000s, this data has been available in real-time to city staff and, more recently, to the public on the [Open Baltimore data portal](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Housing-Development/Vacant-Buildings/qqcv-ihn5). 

Today, Baltimore Housing reports that the city has approximately 16,000 vacant buildings and 14,000 vacant lots for a total of around 30,000 vacant properties. More than 75% of all vacant property in Baltimore City is privately owned. But if you use a different definition of vacant buildings you might come up with a different number. The U.S. Census Bureau counts vacant dwelling units coming up with 46,782 (2010). Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance made an estimate in 2015 based on both city and Census Bureau criteria of 31,370.

A [2015 report on Vacants to Value](http://www.abell.org/publications/vacants-value) from the Abell Foundation, notes that some advocates are "concerned that Baltimore Housing's metric undercounts the number of vacant properties and thus understates the city's vacancy problem." In 2014, volunteers with [Housing Our Neighbors](http://www.honbaltimore.org/) (HON), surveyed unoccupied houses in McElderry Park and Middle East by walking each block in these neighborhoods, talking to residents, and using a checklist to decide what houses were vacant. HON counted 381 vacant buildings including 159 (41.7%) buildings where Baltimore Housing had not assigned a vacant building notice (VBN).

### How many vacant buildings does Baltimore have?

Baltimore Housing reports that the city has approximately 16,000 vacant buildings and 14,000 vacant lots totalling around 30,000 vacant properties. More than 75% of all vacant property in Baltimore City is privately owned. But if you use a different definition of vacant buildings you might come up with a different number.

### Why did the number of vacant buildings increase over time?

Scholars and researchers who study urban history, housing, and public policy have studied the history of vacancy and population loss in Baltimore and similar legacy cities. Their research and writing points to three big reasons for the city’s large number of vacant buildings:

- Job and population loss
- Suburban growth
- Racial segregation and discrimination

#### Job and population loss

Over the past six decades, Baltimore City has lost population. In 1950, 950,000 people lived in the city. Sixty years later, the population had dropped by 325,000 people. In the decades after World War II, the city lost thousands of factory jobs to suburban industrial parks, to increased automation, and to Southern states with anti-union policies. This pattern of declining investment in downtown Baltimore, a shrinking number of well-paying industrial jobs, and growing financial insecurity for Baltimore residents forced thousands of Baltimore residents to move away and, in some cases, leave abandoned homes behind.

#### Suburban growth

As Baltimore City lost residents, the surrounding counties gained both population and jobs. New homes in the suburbs attracted residents who might otherwise live in existing homes in Baltimore City. The movement of new factories and shopping malls brought employment opportunities to the suburbs but limited access to employment for city residents. The state and federal government subsidized suburban growth in Baltimore with funding for new highways like Interstate 695 and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) mortgage aid. Racist policies in the planning and administration of these programs, however, limited the benefits to white residents. As the suburbs grew, existing patterns of segregation and inequality became even more deeply entrenched.

#### Racial segregation and discrimination

Vacant buildings today are the legacy of segregated housing and racial discrimination in the past. Notorious practices like "redlining" in the 1930s and "block-busting" in the 1950s and 1960s are not relics of the past. Even in the present, African American residents in the Baltimore region are unable to access home loans, employment opportunities, and transportation to the same extent as white residents.

As a result of these policies, many vacant buildings are located in historically segregated African American neighborhoods in east and west Baltimore. This is illustrated by looking beyond Baltimore’s average vacancy rate of 8.03% (2013) to consider the disparate impact of vacant buildings on black and white residents. An analysis is based on data from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance [Vital Signs 2014](http://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/) report finds that in neighborhoods where less than 50% of residents are black, the vacancy rate is 2.54%. In neighborhoods where more than 80% residents are black, the rate is 13.54%.

| Community Statistical Areas (2010) | Average vacancy rate (2013) | Percent of total vacant properties (2013) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| All areas                          | 8.03%                       | 100%                                     |
| Areas with <50% black residents    | 2.54%                       | 34.60%                                   |
| Areas with >50% black residents    | 10.37%                      | 65.46%                                   |
| Areas with >80% black residents    | 13.54%                      | 42.90%                                   |
