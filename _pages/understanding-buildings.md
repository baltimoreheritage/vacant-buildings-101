Understanding vacant buildings begins by asking three simple questions:

- Why does Baltimore have so many vacant buildings?
- Why is it hard to fix up and reuse vacant buildings?
- What does Baltimore do about vacant buildings?

These might be simple questions but they are difficult to answer.

Counting vacant buildings depends on how you define a “vacant building.” All unoccupied buildings are not “vacant” by any definition. However, many local housing advocates are concerned that city’s list of “vacant building notices” is significantly less than the true total of abandoned buildings. 

Identifying barriers to building reuse depends on who you ask. If you are a developer, you may focus on the difficulty of acquiring vacant buildings. If you are an urban planner, you may talk about the lack of market demand.

Describing the city’s policy and approach to vacant buildings depends on if you look at individual buildings, whole neighborhoods, or city-wide policies. In all cases, the city’s approach to vacant buildings has developed over decades and continues to change based on direction set by elected officials and city staff along with the demands of Baltimore residents.
