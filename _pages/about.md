## What is Vacant Buildings 101?

Vacant buildings are a problem for people all across Baltimore City. [Baltimore Heritage](https://baltimoreheritage.org/) and the [Community Law Center](http://communitylaw.org/) created Vacant Buildings 101 as a guide for Baltimore residents, property owners, and community leaders to help you take action on vacant buildings on your block and in your neighborhood. Read on to learn how vacant buildings are fixed up and torn down, how to advocate for policies that encourage building reuse, what you can expect when you call 311, and more.

This guide was written by Eli Pousson and Becky Witt with support from [Preservation Maryland](http://www.preservationmaryland.org/) and the [Maryland Historical Trust](http://mht.maryland.gov/) through the Heritage Fund.

Wherever you begin, remember that different approaches work for different buildings and neighborhoods. In most cases, there are a range of options available to residents, property owners, and community organizations. Some approaches work when you are dealing with a single vacant building. Other approaches only work when you are dealing with broader vacancy in your neighborhood. When we talk about vacant buildings in this guide, we are often talking about vacant houses. Vacant industrial buildings, vacant religious buildings, or vacant commercial buildings may require yet another approach.
