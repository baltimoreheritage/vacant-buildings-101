**What is the problem with vacant buildings?**

Vacant buildings can cause serious problems for nearby residents and property owners.

- If you rent an attached rowhouse, a vacant house next door may mean problems with pests (like mice or rats); structural problems with your roof or party wall; and an increased risk of fire or property crime.
- If you own a home with a vacant next door, you may worry about how nearby vacant buildings could increase your heating and insurance costs; decrease the value of your home; and make it more difficult for you to sell your home if you choose to move in the future.
- If you lead a community organization, you may worry about how vacant properties can contribute to public safety risks; make your community less attractive; or worry about what how any reductions in the city’s property tax income might affect public services like parks or sanitation.

None of these problems have easy or simple solutions. And in some communities vacant buildings are a big problem. You can't solve this issue all on your own.

But if you work together with your neighbors, elected officials, city employees, local nonprofits, and developers, you can start solving the problem of vacant buildings in your neighborhood:

- **Neighborhood associations** can take legal action to force a negligent property owner to secure a vacant building or clean up a yard overrun by weeds and debris.
- **Private developers** can repair vacant buildings and put them back into use as homes or apartments.
- **Baltimore City** can tear down a block of vacant buildings and volunteers can adopt the lot as community open space.
- **Local nonprofits** can offer financial counseling to struggling neighbors and _prevent_ abandonment by helping residents stay in their homes.

But we want you to remember that sometimes vacant buildings are a problem but they are also the result of bigger problems that have shaped Baltimore and our region for decades. You can’t talk about vacant buildings without talking about local and national issues, including:

- Economic development and opportunity
- Suburban growth and transportation
- Racial segregation and discrimination

Understanding how these issues affect you and your neighborhood can help you start conversations about vacant buildings and build support for solutions.
