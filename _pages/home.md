## What is Vacant Buildings 101?

Our Vacant Buildings 101 guide is designed to help you take action on vacant buildings on your block and in your neighborhood. Learn how vacant buildings are fixed up and torn down, how to advocate for policies that encourage building reuse, what you can expect when you call 311, and more.

The guide is currently available as [an open Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OveSvPTXjlmqLWy-pccWN3GFiBuywvzNXRsjxDBbbVs/edit?usp=sharing). Please help us make this resource better for everyone!
