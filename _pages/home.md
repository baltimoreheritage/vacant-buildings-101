## What is Vacant Buildings 101?

Vacant Buildings 101 is your guide to taking action on vacant buildings on your block and in your neighborhood. Learn how vacant buildings are fixed up and torn down, how to advocate for policies that encourage building reuse, what you can expect when you call 311, and more.

We are working to turn our guide from [an open Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OveSvPTXjlmqLWy-pccWN3GFiBuywvzNXRsjxDBbbVs/edit?usp=sharing) into a collection of free educational resources.
